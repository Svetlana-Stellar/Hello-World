# Hello-World
Svetlana Stellar welcome to the world of programming! Good luck!

It is a very important period of my life right now- I became a Hero in a + Dimension. Now my task is to go from bad to wellness and to become a goddness- to become the Best in something. That is why it is very important to choose the correct field for it.
I have doubts. Frontend Developer or Automation QA? If the company needs me as QA- ok. If not, I go to frontend courses at my own expense.
